# System Overview
The proposed system is a student activity tracker that tracks whether a student is present in a given event or not. The software application allows the administrator to add, edit, and search students and events, tally attendance points, show the list of all students and events, show upcoming events, and handle sanctions. There are four options that the user can select upon opening the application and logging in. These are the Event list, Student list, Input Attendance, and Attendance Checker. 

# Purpose of the System
The purpose of the system is to promote efficiency by removing the use of event tickets and activity cards, which the school requires the students to have whenever an event occurs. By moving the entire procedure online, the school can avoid or reduce existing problems such as students misplacing their event tickets, student favoritism by student council officers, or students forging their event tickets.

# Language and Framework Used
I used C# and implemented the .NET framework using Visual Studio as my platform for writing code.
